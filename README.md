## Understanding the Project Based on the Image

**Project Purpose:**

 This project is a collection of Groovy scripts designed for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. The scripts cover various aspects of CI/CD, such as:

* **Agent management:** `add-agent-each-stage.groovy`
* **Job orchestration:** `call-job1-from-job2.groovy`
* **Advanced CI/CD concepts:** `ci-cd-advanced.groovy`, `complete-ci-cd.groovy`
* **Environment management:** `environment-variables.groovy`
* **Error handling:** `error-handling.groovy`
* **User interaction:** `manual-input.groovy`
* **Parallel execution:** `parallel-stages.groovy`
* **Pipeline configuration:** `parameters-triggers.groovy`
* **Notifications:** `sending-email.groovy`
* **Conditional execution:** `when-condition.groovy`

**Target Audience:**

This project seems to be intended for developers and DevOps engineers who are familiar with Groovy and Jenkins (or a similar CI/CD platform).
